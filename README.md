# math-package-
Hello everyone!

This package is a comprehensive math package that includes most important and common formulas 
in mathematic and geometry.
This package covers mathematic formulas taught in highschool and elementary school.Although we have many complete math packages in python, this one would include 
majority of the useful formulas, rules and functions that don't consist in that packages.(check the code to learn more:))
During the years of my education, after learning new mathematical formulas I will add them in package!(as far as possible)
so I'm still working on it :)
I'm a student and a junior python programmer, I would definitely appreciate any recommendation for better operation in my code!
